Batch Novell Group Add
======================

Batch Novell Group Add is used to add novell user objects to a specified novell group via the membership attribute. The user objects to be affected can either all appear in an input file using the following format: .LTTCRA003.Students.com.main.uct or be inputted one at a time. Similarly groups can be specified singly or listed in a text file.

This application will only work correctly if trying to affect accounts over which the current logged-in Novell user has administration rights over.
